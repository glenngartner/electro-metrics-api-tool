## Electro-Metrics API Tool

A quick tool for testing the blocmetrics api messages

For this to work locally, add this url to a registered application in Blocmetrics:
```bash
file://
```
Launch the app using:

```bash
npm start
```

If you're running it for the first time, run
```bash
npm install
```
Then
```bash
npm start
```
